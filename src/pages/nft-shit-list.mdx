# NFT Shit List

Listen. There’s a time and a place for debate but we at IRCB have decided that the creation, purchase, and perpetuation of NFTs is bad; bad for the art community and bad for the environment. If you need to know why, go ahead and read [this](https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3) and [this](https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/energy/544778-heard-nfts-are-bad-for-the-environment-heres-what-that) and [this](https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/) and [this](https://mashable.com/article/nft-cryptocurrency-bad-environment-art/).

To do our part, IRCB has put together the following list of comic creators who have decided to create and sell NFTs in case you were ever curious and wanted to know.

For the record: This list is not definitive and will be ever growing, so make sure to check back. And if you know of someone who should be on this list, shoot us an email: **ircbpodcast@gmail.com**
