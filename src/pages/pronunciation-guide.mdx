# Comic Book Industry Name Pronunciation Guide

We at I Read Comic Books have, well, a problem pronouncing the names of the incredible people who create, assist, and publish comic books. As a result of this troubling issue, we have started a list of names and the pronunciations as a way to help ourselves, but also to help the general comics public.

For the various pronunciations provided, we will be following the [Pronunciation spelling for English guide as defined on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_respelling_for_English).

If you have any names we missed, are a creator who would like your name added, or think we messed something up, [shoot us an email](mailto:ircb@destroythecyb.org?subject=Hey!%20Fix%20this%20name!) (ircb@destroythecyb.org) or [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hey!%20@ircbpodcast!%20Fix%20this%20name!) ([@ircbpodcast](http://www.twitter.com/ircbpodcast)).
